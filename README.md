# Codewars Checker

A tool for bulk-checking whether users have completed a certain set of Codewars kata. Used for [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com) application requirements.

##Â Run locally

You'll need the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed. We rely on Netlify redirects to proxy to the Codewars API since it doesn't supports CORS.
